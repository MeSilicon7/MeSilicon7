**Hi, I'm 메헤디, an independent developer**

I've had a strong interest in programming since I was in elementary school. This zeal has only grown as I begin my first year of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE). Python remains my core strength, and my knowledge of frameworks such as Django and Flask demonstrates my deep interest in web development.

Aside from Python, I'm also proficient in JavaScript, Rust, and PHP, increasing my knowledge of programming languages. My development talents extend to WordPress as well, demonstrating my versatility in online platforms.

I have polished my talents in vector graphic design, a tribute to my ability to mix aesthetics with practicality, bringing to life user-centric and visually appealing designs.

In the field of artificial intelligence, I am particularly interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which I am exploring with PyTorch, an invaluable tool in my development toolset.

My choices show a penchant for Linux-based operating systems, with Ubuntu powering my laptop and the technologically advanced Fedora running on my desktop. This preference demonstrates my thorough understanding of the Linux ecosystem.

I also have hands-on expertise with embedded systems like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. My knowledge also extends to cloud services, having competence with AWS, and I've dug deep into the complexities of System Design.

As I progress through my studies in EEE and the vast world of programming and design, I hope to weave together my diverse abilities and interests. My ambition is to make unique and significant contributions to the ever-changing technology scene.

<!--
In addition to my technical interests, I also have a sensitive side. I'm fascinated by Korean culture and frequently lose myself in K-Pop and Korean dramas in my spare time. These pursuits give me the ideal outlet for unwinding and serve as a balance to my professionally focused on technology pursuits.
