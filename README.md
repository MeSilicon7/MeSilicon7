**Hi, I'm 메헤디, an independent developer**

I'm currently studying in my first year of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE), where I've developed a fierce enthusiasm for programming and a keen comprehension of numerous programming languages. My primary area of expertise is Python, and my use of frameworks like Django and Flask demonstrates my strong affinity for web programming.

Along with my proficiency in Python, I also have a solid knowledge of JavaScript and Rust. I've also refined my coding abilities in the area of PHP development, broadening my repertoire of computer languages. 

Beyond programming, I have a passion for Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which I tackle using my knowledge of PyTorch, a crucial tool in my programming toolbox.

I find that I tend to favor operating systems that are based on Linux. My laptop runs Ubuntu, which is dependable and user-friendly, while my desktop runs Fedora, which is renowned for its cutting-edge technology and robust performance. I take great satisfaction in my comprehensive knowledge and comprehension of the Linux operating system, which further strengthens my technological proficiency.

<!--
In addition to my technical interests, I also have a sensitive side. I'm fascinated by Korean culture and frequently lose myself in K-Pop and Korean dramas in my spare time. These pursuits give me the ideal outlet for unwinding and serve as a balance to my professionally focused on technology pursuits.
-->
As I proceed down my path in EEE and programming, I hope to combine my wide range of interests and abilities to contribute in a distinctive way to this rapidly changing technical environment.
